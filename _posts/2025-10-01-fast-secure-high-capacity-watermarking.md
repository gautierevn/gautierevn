## Highlights

- Encode natural-language prompts into robust watermark vectors that survive typical sharing pipelines.
- Balance payload size and secrecy with an adversarial training loop that keeps the watermark imperceptible.
- Deliver a fast inference path compatible with modern diffusion systems for large-scale provenance tracking.

Code will be published alongside the camera-ready release, stay tuned.
